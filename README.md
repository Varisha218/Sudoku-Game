# Sudoku Game

A console-based Sudoku game implemented in C++ with a graphical interface using SFML. This project includes functionality for playing, solving, and resetting the Sudoku puzzle.

## Features

- **Sudoku Board**: A 9x9 grid where users can enter numbers to solve the puzzle.
- **Solve Automatically**: The game supports an auto-solve feature that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
- **Reset**: Users can reset the board to its initial state.
- **Validation**: The game validates user input to ensure that the Sudoku rules are followed (no repeated numbers in rows, columns, or subgrids).
- **Graphical Interface**: The game features a simple graphical interface using SFML to interact with the user.
